# Lichess Discord
A Firefox extension that allows you to create a game and post it to the server of your choice with just 2 clicks!\
The extension uses the Discord API, lichess API, and webhooks to generate and post lichess game links in the Discord server of your choice.
There's also an option to copy a new link in order to post it wherever you'd like.\
To use, simply download from the Firefox Store (to be added later).\
To copy a link, choose your game settings and click copy link.\
To post to discord, sign in with Discord and add a [webhook](https://youtu.be/fKksxz2Gdnc?t=13) to the server of your choice (one-time process). Then, whenever you want to challenge a friend, choose your game settings and pick the server to send the link to!
